# React Project

A boilerplate react project using Gulp, Browserify, Babelify, and Less.

Use project commands to build and serve project:
* `yarn run build` Builds react, less files, copies files to `dist` directory.
* `yarn run server` Starts server, serving `dist`.
* `yarn run up` Builds react, compiles less, and serves `dist` directory.

If you're using `npm`, simply replace `yarn` with `npm` in the above commands.
